# ðŸ“… Course Calendar App

This project was built following along to this tutorial (https://youtube.com/embed/pHMtbdGoP_g) on FreeCodeCamp to practice PHP, JavaScript, and CSS.
This is my first time working with JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and PHP and first time using Github to document the work.
It was interesting and I learned a lot.
